ACID Pro 6.0 includes drum, control, and program map template files for
a number of MIDI hardware devices. In many cases, we do not have access
to this hardware to verify these template files, so they are officially
unsupported. However, we encourage you to send updates to:

  MD-MIDI-Devices@sonyconnect.com

so that we may include corrections and support for additional devices in
future releases.

Thank you,

- The ACID team
